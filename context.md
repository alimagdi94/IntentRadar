# Project Support Context

## Mission
Start a zero-capital startup by identifying monetizable problems on social media (Reddit, Facebook) using a custom "dorking" app. Use free trials of services to solve these problems for clients.

## App Requirements
- **Type**: Web Application
- **Functionality**:
    - Reddit and Facebook Dorking (Advanced Search Query Generation).
    - Keywords support: English and Arabic (specifically Egyptian dialect/Market).
    - Goal: Find posts asking for services or help that can be monetized.
- **Design**:
    - High-end, premium aesthetic.
    - Glassmorphism, vibrant colors, dark mode.
    - Dynamic animations.

## Target Audience
- People asking for help on social media.
- Focus on queries like "I need a designer", "looking for software", "how to fix", etc., in both English and Egyptian Arabic (e.g., "عايز حد يعمل", "محتاج", "حد يعرف").

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vite (React) for dynamic interaction and premium feel.
- Styling: Plain CSS (Module or standard) for maximum control over aesthetics (Glassmorphism).

## Current Status
- Project Initialized.
- Premium UI implemented with Glassmorphism.
- Dorking logic implemented for Reddit and Facebook.
- Egyptian Arabic keywords (Context aware) added.
- **Ready for use** (Run `npm run dev`).
